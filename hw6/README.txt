[ AE FOR CREDIT ]

- Make sure that your gif and all other cell outputs are present in your notebook!

- Confirm that the digits are able to be reconstructed in the bottleneck
   - Make a few notes below talking about whether or not this is interesting and/or useful.

- Confirm that the latent encoding's decomposition roughly matches with original data's.
   - Comment a bit on it. Is this a good sign? Does it have any use?



[ VAE FOR CREDIT ]

- Make sure both of your gifs are present in the notebook!

- Talk about a potential application that you think it would be cool to applied VAEs to.

Using latent space VAEs we are able to create music. We can input differnt baselines and modelodies and create new songs. Cite below.

[ GAN FOR CREDIT | BONUS ]

- Make sure that your gif and all other cell outputs are present in your notebook!

- Discuss a bit about the pros and cons of using a GAN in this context. 

The advantage of using GAN is that given enough data and model complexity, the generated image would be very similar to the input image since it uses a discriminator and a generator. 
However, the disadvantage of using GAN is that it takes a very long time to train and we need a lot of data.

- For 2470 students, the above will give you half of the bonus points. The other half can be obtained by trying out the WGAN-GP model below.
